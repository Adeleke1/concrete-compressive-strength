# concrete-compressive-strength
* This was part of a class project where different variables are used to predict the concrete compressive strength 
* Exploratory Data analysis was performed to clean the [data](https://github.com/Adeleke1/concrete-compressive-strength/blob/main/Concrete_Data.xls)
* Data was normalized using Z-score approach
* Algorithms used: Lasso and Ridge Regression
* Models were developed using the two ML algorithms and for each model, different values were assumed for the penalty function
* The effect of different values of penalty parameter on feature selection was studied.
* 5-fold validation was used to chose the penalty parameter for the predictive model based on Lasso Regression.
